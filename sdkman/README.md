Docker SDKMAN Kotlin

This image is intended to be used via Concourse as part of custom development tasks.  This is still primarily POC oriented work.  Sdkman just makes installing a lot of the JVM-related toolchain painless, so this is a good starting point for most builds/tools.

Specifically, I'm looking to be able to create Concourse tasks written in Kotlin (kscript) instead of BASH.ls
